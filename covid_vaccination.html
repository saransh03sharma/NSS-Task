<p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The world seems to have come
to a halt of a sudden. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt
differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.<br>The
pandemic has impacted almost every corner of life, causing global economies to stall,
changing the way we work and interact with others, and stretching healthcare systems to the
limit. Governments around the world have been forced to implement harsh restrictions on
human activity to curb the spread of the virus.<br><br>
the COVID-19 vaccine seems to be the only feasible solution for immunity against
the virus; along with maintaining the proper Covid19 guidelines and safety protocols, such as
masking up, maintaining social distance in public places, etc. Although, it is impossible to
vaccinate the whole population in India in short period of time, the vaccination drive has
already started in an effective manner. The aim is to vaccinate as much of the population as
possible.<br>
The Government started the vaccination on <b>16th January 2021</b>. COVID-19 vaccination is now offering a way to transition out of this phase
of the pandemic. Without them, many scientists believe that natural herd immunity would not
have been sufficient to restore society to its normal status quo and that it would have resulted
in extreme fatality.</p>
<p>India’s drug regulator DCGI has already approved 6 vaccines in india out of which 3 are already there in market. The vaccines approved include <b>Johnson & Johnson, ZyCoV-D, Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik, and Moderna.</b> while covisheild, covaxin and sputnik are already there in the market. </p>
<hr class="major" />
<h2>Covisheild</h2>
<p><b>Type:</b> It is a recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein.</p>
<p><b>Number of doses:</b> It consists of two doses of 0.5 ml each.</p>
<p><b>Duration between doses:</b> The Indian government has recommended that the time interval between the 1st and 2nd dose should be between 12-16 weeks.</p>
<p><b>Adverse reactions possible:</b> <br>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) - tenderness, pain, warmth, or itching where the injection is given, generally feeling unwell, feeling tired (fatigue), chills or feeling feverish, headache, feeling sick (nausea), joint pain or muscle ache.
<br><br>Common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) - swelling or redness where the injection is given, fever, being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea, pain in legs or arms, flu-like symptoms, such as high temperature sore throat, runny nose, cough and chills.
<br><br>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) – sleepiness or feeling dizzy, abdominal pain, enlarged lymph nodes, excessive sweating, itchy skin, rash or hives
Not known (the frequency cannot be determined from the available data) -severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), severe swelling of the lips, mouth, throat (which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing).
<br><br>Rarest: Major blood clotting (venous and/or arterial thrombosis) in combination with low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) have been observed very rarely (with a frequency less than 1 in 100,000 vaccinated individuals).</p>
<p><b>Second dose of vaccine if I get COVID-19 disease after first dose of vaccine?</b><br>
As per the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHWF), you can take the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine 3 months after recovery from COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>₹780 for private hospitals. Free of cost at Governmental hospitals.</p> 
<p><b>Efficiency: </b>81.3%</p>

<hr class="major" />
<h2>Covaxin</h2>
<p><b>Type:</b> The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects. They contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an infection.</p>
<p><b>Number of doses:</b> It consists of two doses.</p>
<p><b>Duration between doses:</b> The Indian government has recommended that the time interval between the 1st and 2nd dose should be 28 days.</p>
<p><b>Adverse reactions possible:</b> <br>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) - tenderness, pain, warmth, or itching where the injection is given, generally feeling unwell, feeling tired (fatigue), chills or feeling feverish, headache, feeling sick (nausea), joint pain or muscle ache.
<br><br>Common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) - swelling or redness where the injection is given, fever, being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea, pain in legs or arms, flu-like symptoms, such as high temperature sore throat, runny nose, cough and chills.
<p><b>Second dose of vaccine if I get COVID-19 disease after first dose of vaccine?</b><br>
As per the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHWF), you can take the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine 3 months after recovery from COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b> ₹1,410 for private hospitals. Free of cost at Governmental hospitals.</p>
<p><b>Efficiency: </b>77.8%</p>
